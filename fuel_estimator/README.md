# fuel_estimator

Fuel Estimator is a simple, single-purpose Flutter utility app built for the A251 Lab Assignment. It allows a user to quickly estimate the total fuel cost for a trip. The user provides their travel distance, their car's fuel efficiency, and selects a current fuel type to get an instant cost calculation.

## Inputs, Process, and Output

Inputs:
Fuel Type: The user selects a fuel type from a dropdown menu (e.g., 'BUDI95', 'RON95', 'RON97', 'DIESEL').

Distance (km): The user enters the total trip distance into a text field.

Car Fuel Efficiency (km/L): The user enters their car's efficiency rating into a second text field.

Process:
When the user selects a fuel type, the app's state is updated via setState to store the selection and display its price per liter.

When the user presses the "Calculate Fuel Cost" button, the app triggers the calculateFuelCost function.

This function first validates the inputs. If any field is empty, non-numeric, or zero, it sets an error message.

If the inputs are valid, it calculates the cost using the formula: (Distance / Efficiency) * Fuel_Price_Per_Liter.

The function calls setState to update the UI with the final cost or the error message.

Output:
Estimated Cost: The final calculated cost is displayed in a styled container, formatted to two decimal places (e.g., "Estimated Cost: RM 15.42").

Error Message: If validation fails, a red error message (e.g., "Please fill all fields with valid numbers.") is shown.

## Widget List Used
The primary widgets used are:

Text: Used for all labels, the app bar title, the result, and the validation error message.

TextField: Used for the "Distance" and "Car Fuel Efficiency" inputs, with keyboardType set to TextInputType.number.

DropdownButton: Used for selecting the "Fuel Type" from a predefined Map of prices.

ElevatedButton: Used for the "Calculate Fuel Cost" and "Reset" buttons.

Row / Column: These are the primary layout widgets used to structure the entire home screen.

Container: Used to add padding, border, and background color to the final result area.

Other widgets: Scaffold (for basic screen structure), AppBar, SingleChildScrollView (to prevent overflow), and SizedBox (for spacing).

## Basic Validation Approach

The app handles invalid inputs to prevent crashes:

Parsing: User input from TextFields is parsed using double.tryParse(...) ?? 0.0. This ensures that if a user enters non-numeric text (or leaves it empty), it defaults to 0.0 instead of crashing the app.

Logical Check: The calculateFuelCost function checks if the parsed distance or efficiency values are <= 0, or if the fuelType is null (meaning not selected).

User Feedback: If this check fails, the errorMessage state variable is updated with a friendly message, and estimatedCost is set to 0.0. A call to setState then displays this error message in a red Text widget below the result.
